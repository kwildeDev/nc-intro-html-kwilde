                <li>Tuna</li>
                <li>Tuna and shrimp</li>
                <li>Ocean Fish and Tuna</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="traits">Lovable traits</h2>
            <p>If you go into the back garden and call out "Oscar" or "Ozzy" you will often see him appear or jump down from somewhere, run towards you and miaow enthusiastically. He deserves a big fuss and/or some treats after that.</p>
            <p>He enjoys getting on top of the water butt just outside the kitchen so he can paw at the kitchen window at us and miaow as if he can't get back in when there is a cat flap 2 metres away.</p>
            <p>He loves sitting on the top of the settee cushions just behind people's heads.</p>

                <li>Scratching the settees.</li>
                <li>Trying to get outside by jumping on the bathroom windowsill via the sink and leaving hairs everywhere.</li>
                <li>Deciding that the best part of the furniture to sleep on is on top of my black trousers or blazer.</li>
